# SafeStay 🏨🚨

**Rapid Crisis Response System for Hotels & Hospitals**

A real-time emergency alert platform enabling guests to report safety concerns instantly, while providing property managers and emergency services with critical location and incident details.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

SafeStay is a crisis management system designed for hotels, hospitals, and similar facilities. It provides:

- **Guest Portal**: Quick access to report safety status (Safe ✓ or Need Help 🆘) with specific emergency types
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of guest statuses across multiple floors and rooms
- **Emergency Response**: Critical location information and emergency contacts for first responders
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Each property has its own admin account, guest portal, and emergency data

### Key Problem Solved
Traditional emergency response in large facilities relies on guests finding phones or staff—precious seconds lost in a crisis. SafeStay enables **immediate, one-tap emergency alerts** with location data.

### Key Components & Interactions

| Component | Function | Data Source |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Guest Portal** | Report status/emergency | User input |
| **Room Context** | Manages all room states | Firestore "rooms" collection |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Displays real-time status | Room Context listeners |
| **Property Context** | Manages location info | Firestore "property" document |
| **Firestore DB** | Single source of truth | All changes sync here |
| **AI Analyzer** | Recommends responses | Analyzes all active emergencies |

### Real-time Synchronization

- **Database**: Firestore (Google's real-time database)
- **Listeners**: Both guest portal and admin dashboard have active listeners
- **Updates**: When any change occurs, ALL connected devices see it instantly
- **Latency**: Typically < 500ms from guest action to admin notification
- **Offline Support**: Data queued locally, synced when reconnected
